# Term-Project
The project is based on a Course registration platform based with the help of the data is been provided. 
To create the report for the registration a certain format has been used.
I have used two sample set of Data one for the course databse and the other for Student database
The embedded report output will have the Sectional details of each student with their Name, course, course id etc.

The data shet considered is of a small dataset but  this can be used for a large dataset too.

The data is stored in a .csv file as it much easier to implement it rather than using a Panda etc

The File path for the library can be modified asper the users file allocation.

String, Nested arrays can also be used but I choose tuple approach for code elegance and simplicity.

Usage of List is used with outer and inner loops
