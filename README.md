# Term-Project
The main goal here is to create a “guess the word” game. It has certain key things one needs to note.   The user needs to be able to input letter guesses. A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. Keep notifying the user of the remaining turns.
While executing the code, the loops were implemented to run the program
The random and the time modules were imported. Passig the function for the program to run.
